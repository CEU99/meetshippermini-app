- ✅ Users can only SELECT suggestions where they're participants
- ✅ Users CANNOT see their own suggestions after creation
- ✅ Only participants can UPDATE (accept/decline)
- ✅ Service role has full access (for automation)

### Data Validation
- ✅ Server-side validation of all inputs
- ✅ Database constraints prevent invalid data
- ✅ Unique constraints prevent duplicates
- ✅ CHECK constraints enforce business rules

## 📈 Metrics to Track

```sql
-- Suggestion analytics
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_suggestions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 END) as accepted,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'declined' THEN 1 END) as declined,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status LIKE 'accepted_by_%' THEN 1 END) as pending,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as acceptance_rate
FROM match_suggestions;

-- Most active suggesters
SELECT
  created_by_fid,
  COUNT(*) as suggestions_created,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 END) as successful
FROM match_suggestions
GROUP BY created_by_fid
ORDER BY suggestions_created DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Active cooldowns
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_cooldowns
FROM match_suggestion_cooldowns
WHERE cooldown_until > now();
```

## 🎨 UI Screenshots Locations

- Dashboard: "Suggest Match" button in Quick Actions
- Suggest page: `/mini/suggest` form
- Inbox: "Suggestions" tab with cards
- Chat room: Standard chat interface (existing)

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create suggestion with two valid FIDs
- [ ] User A sees suggestion in inbox
- [ ] User B sees suggestion in inbox
- [ ] Neither user can see suggester identity
- [ ] User A accepts → status updates to "accepted_by_a"
- [ ] User B accepts → chat room is created
- [ ] Both users can open chat room
- [ ] User declines → cooldown is created
- [ ] Try re-suggesting same pair → should fail with cooldown error
- [ ] Wait 7 days (or manually delete cooldown) → can suggest again
