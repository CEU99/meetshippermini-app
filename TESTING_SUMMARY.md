## 🔧 Manual Testing Checklist

After migration is run, perform these manual tests:

### Test 1: Match Acceptance Flow
- [ ] Create new match between two test users
- [ ] Accept from User A
- [ ] Accept from User B
- [ ] Verify both see "MeetShipper Conversation Room" button
- [ ] Verify button appears in inbox "Accepted" tab

### Test 2: Open Room
- [ ] Click "MeetShipper Conversation Room" button
- [ ] Verify route: `/mini/meetshipper-room/[id]`
- [ ] Verify both participants displayed with avatars
- [ ] Verify instructions and conversation area visible
- [ ] Verify "Leave Room" and "Conversation Completed" buttons present

### Test 3: Leave and Re-enter Room
- [ ] Click "Leave Room" → Returns to inbox
- [ ] Click button again → Re-enters same room
- [ ] Verify room state persisted (not reset)

### Test 4: Close Room
- [ ] Click "Conversation Completed"
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Confirm closure
- [ ] Verify redirect to inbox
- [ ] Verify button no longer appears for this match
- [ ] Log in as other user
- [ ] Verify other user also doesn't see button

### Test 5: Suggestions Flow
- [ ] Create match suggestion between two users
- [ ] Both users accept
- [ ] Verify "MeetShipper Conversation Room" button appears
- [ ] Verify same room behavior as regular matches

## 🔐 Security Verification

### RLS Policy Tests (Post-Migration)

```sql
-- Test 1: User can see their own room
-- Login as user 1401992
SELECT * FROM meetshipper_rooms WHERE user_a_fid = 1401992 OR user_b_fid = 1401992;
-- Expected: Returns rooms where user is participant

-- Test 2: User cannot see other's rooms
-- Login as user 999999
SELECT * FROM meetshipper_rooms WHERE match_id = '50a7a1f2-df27-4f22-a03d-91978dee1648';
-- Expected: Returns empty (user not a participant)

-- Test 3: User can close their room
-- Login as user 1401992
UPDATE meetshipper_rooms
SET is_closed = true, closed_by_fid = 1401992, closed_at = NOW()
WHERE match_id = '50a7a1f2-df27-4f22-a03d-91978dee1648';
-- Expected: Success

-- Test 4: User cannot close others' rooms
-- Login as user 999999
UPDATE meetshipper_rooms
SET is_closed = true
WHERE match_id = 'some-other-match-id';
-- Expected: Fails with RLS violation
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Query Times
- Fetch rooms for inbox (bulk): < 100ms
- Fetch single room with users: < 50ms
- Close room: < 30ms
- Check if room exists: < 20ms

### Database Load
- Expected: Minimal increase
- Rooms created only on match acceptance (not frequently)
- Closure is one-time update per room
- Indexes optimize all common queries

---

## 🎯 Test Data Available

### Production Matches Ready for Testing

```
User Pair: 1401992 ↔ 543581
Available Matches: 4
All Status: accepted, both accepted ✅

User Pair: 1424386 ↔ 543581
Available Matches: 1
Status: accepted, both accepted ✅
```

**Recommendation:** Use match `50a7a1f2-df27-4f22-a03d-91978dee1648` for first manual test.
