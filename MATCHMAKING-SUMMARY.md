# Matchmaking System Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

A comprehensive automatic and manual matchmaking system has been successfully implemented with the following features:

---

## 🎯 Core Features Delivered

### 1. **Automatic Matching System**
- ✅ Runs every 3 hours via Vercel Cron
- ✅ Analyzes user similarity based on traits (60%) and bio keywords (40%)
- ✅ Minimum match score threshold: 0.65
- ✅ Creates up to 3 proposals per user per run
- ✅ 7-day cooldown after declined matches
- ✅ Smart filtering (no duplicate proposals, respects cooldowns)

### 2. **Manual Matching (Admin Tool)**
- ✅ Existing create match form enhanced
- ✅ Tracks creator as `admin:<fid>`
- ✅ Same approval workflow as auto-matches
- ✅ Displays in inbox with special badge

### 3. **Two-Sided Consent System**
- ✅ Both users must accept before meeting scheduled
- ✅ Status tracking: `proposed` → `accepted_by_a/b` → `accepted`
- ✅ Either user can decline
- ✅ Declined matches appear in inbox history

### 4. **Meeting Scheduling**
- ✅ Automatic meeting link generation after mutual acceptance

- ✅ Whereby/Huddle01 integration ready (requires API keys)
- ✅ "Join Meeting" button in inbox
- ✅ Reschedule capability

### 5. **Enhanced Inbox UI**
- ✅ Four organized tabs:
  - **Pending** - Needs your response (with badge count)
  - **Awaiting** - You accepted, waiting on them
  - **Accepted** - Active matches with meeting links
  - **Declined** - Historical record
- ✅ Match rationale display (shared traits + bio keywords)
- ✅ Match score percentage
- ✅ One-click accept/decline
- ✅ Meeting link prominent when ready

## 🔧 Matching Algorithm Details

### Similarity Scoring

**Trait Similarity (60% weight):**
```
Jaccard Index = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|
Example: [Trader, Investor, Holder] vs [Trader, Holder, Degen]
         = 2 shared / 4 unique = 0.50
```

**Bio Similarity (40% weight):**
```
Keyword Overlap after:
- Lowercase normalization
- Stop word removal
- Length filtering (>3 chars)
Example: "DeFi trader" vs "DeFi investor"
         = 1 shared / 3 unique = 0.33
```

**Overall Score:**
```
0.6 × 0.50 + 0.4 × 0.33 = 0.432

Must be ≥ 0.65 to propose match
```

### Eligibility Criteria

Users eligible for matching:
- ✅ Bio filled out (not null/empty)
- ✅ At least 5 traits selected
- ✅ Not in cooldown with potential match
- ✅ No active match with potential match
- ✅ Less than 3 pending proposals in last 24h

## 🔄 Match Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────┐
│  proposed   │ ← New match created (system or admin)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├─→ User A accepts → accepted_by_a
       │                         │
       │                         └─→ User B accepts → accepted
       │                                                  │
       │                                                  ├→ Meeting scheduled
       │                                                  └→ Join button shown
       │
       └─→ Either declines → declined
                                  │
                                  └→ 7-day cooldown starts
```

## 📊 Key Configuration Parameters

Located in `lib/services/matching-service.ts`:

```typescript
MATCHING_CONFIG = {
  MIN_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 0.65,     // Tune: 0.5 = more matches
  MAX_PROPOSALS_PER_USER: 3,     // Tune: 5 = more options
  COOLDOWN_DAYS: 7,              // Tune: 3 = faster retry
  TRAIT_WEIGHT: 0.6,             // Trait importance
  BIO_WEIGHT: 0.4,               // Bio importance
  AUTO_MATCH_INTERVAL_HOURS: 3,  // Cron frequency
}
```
