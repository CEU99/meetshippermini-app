# Run SQL Diagnostics - Ready to Use ✅

## 🚀 No Configuration Needed!

I've created **ready-to-use** SQL scripts with aysu16's FID (1394398) already filled in.

---

## ⚡ Quick Check (Recommended)

### Step 1: Copy the Script

**File:** `quick-inbox-check-aysu16.sql`

Open the file and copy ALL contents.

### Step 2: Run in Supabase

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Paste the entire script
3. Click **Run** (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)

### Step 3: Review Results

Look at **Step 5: Summary** at the bottom:

**Success looks like:**
```
✅ Match should appear in inbox after fix
Pending matches: 1
```

**If no matches:**
```
⚠️ No pending matches found
Possible reasons:
  - Match already accepted
  - Match declined
```

## 🔍 Comprehensive Diagnosis

### If You Need More Details

**File:** `diagnose-inbox-aysu16.sql`

1. Copy entire file
2. Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Click **Run**
4. Review all 9 steps

**Key results to check:**

**Step 2:** Does match exist between aysu16 and Emir?
- ✅ Shows match record
- ❌ No results = match doesn't exist

**Step 3:** Who is user_a and who is user_b?
- Important for understanding the data

**Step 4:** Will match show for aysu16 with FIXED query?
- ✅ "Would show" = Fix will work
- ❌ "Would NOT show" = Check acceptance flags

**Step 5:** Will match show for Emir?
- ✅ "Would show" = Symmetric behavior
- ❌ "Would NOT show" = Asymmetric (this was the bug)

**Step 8:** Scope summary (most important!)
```
scope    | match_count
---------|------------
inbox    |     1       ← Match exists
pending  |     1       ← Will show in pending ✅
awaiting |     0
accepted |     0
declined |     0
```

## 📊 What the Results Mean

### Scenario 1: "Pending matches: 1" ✅

**Meaning:** The fix will work!

**Next steps:**
1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
3. Login as @aysu16
4. Go to `/mini/inbox`
5. Match should appear in Pending tab

---

### Scenario 2: "No pending matches found" ⚠️

**Possible reasons:**

**A. Match already accepted**
- Check Step 2: Look at `a_accepted` and `b_accepted`
- If aysu16's flag is `true`, they already accepted

**B. Match declined**
- Check Step 2: Look at `status`
- If status is `declined`, match was rejected

**C. Match doesn't exist**
- Check Step 2: No results?
- Match may have been deleted or never created

**D. Wrong user**
- Verify FID in Step 1 matches aysu16

---

### Scenario 3: Inbox = 1, Pending = 0 (Step 8) 🚨

**Meaning:** This is the exact bug the fix addresses!

**Why it happens:**
- Old query filter was broken
- Match exists but filter doesn't catch it

**Solution:**
- The code fix in `app/api/matches/route.ts` solves this
- After applying fix, pending will show 1

   ```bash
   grep -A 8 "scope === 'pending'" app/api/matches/route.ts
   ```

   Should show:

   const pendingConditions = [
     `and(user_a_fid.eq.${userFid},a_accepted.eq.false)`,
     `and(user_b_fid.eq.${userFid},b_accepted.eq.false)`

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "Table match_details does not exist"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
# supabase-fix-match-details-view.sql
```

### Issue: Results show match but with wrong user

**Check:**
- Step 1: Verify FID is 1394398
- If different, user might be duplicate or wrong account

### Issue: No results at all

**Possible causes:**
- aysu16 not in database
- Match was deleted
- Database connection issue

**Debug:**
```sql
-- Verify user exists
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'aysu16';

-- Verify match exists
SELECT * FROM matches
WHERE (user_a_fid = 1394398 OR user_b_fid = 1394398)
  AND (user_a_fid = 543581 OR user_b_fid = 543581);
```
