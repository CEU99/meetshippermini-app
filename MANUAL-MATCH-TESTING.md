## üîç Database Verification Queries

### Check Match Was Created
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  user_a_fid,
  user_b_fid,
  status,
  message,
  rationale,
  a_accepted,
  b_accepted,
  created_by
FROM matches
WHERE user_a_fid = [your_fid]
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:**
- `status = 'proposed'`
- `created_by = 'user'`
- `rationale->>'manualMatch' = 'true'`
- `message` = your introduction message

### Check System Messages Created
```sql
SELECT
  sender_fid,
  content,
  is_system_message,
  created_at
FROM messages
WHERE match_id = '[match_id]'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

**Expected (for accepted match):**
- First message: `Match request: "[your message]"`
- When accepted by one: `[username] accepted the match! Waiting for your response.`
- When both accept (2 messages):
  - Message for User A: `üéâ Match accepted! Both parties agreed to meet. Your meeting link: [link]`
  - Message for User B: `üéâ Match accepted! Both parties agreed to meet. Your meeting link: [link]`
- All have `is_system_message = true`
- Both meeting link messages contain the same URL

### Check Cooldown Created (After Decline)
```sql
SELECT
  user_a_fid,
  user_b_fid,
  declined_at,
  cooldown_until,
  cooldown_until > NOW() as is_active
FROM match_cooldowns
WHERE (user_a_fid, user_b_fid) IN ((a, b), (b, a))
ORDER BY declined_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:**
- `is_active = true`
- `cooldown_until` = ~7 days from now

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "User not found" for valid FID
**Check:**
- User exists in `users` table
- FID is exact match (no extra spaces)

**Fix:**
```sql
SELECT fid, username FROM users WHERE fid = [test_fid];
```

### Issue: Meeting link not generated
**Check:**
- `meeting-service.ts` is configured
- Google Meet API credentials set

**Workaround:**
- System message still sent
- Link generation can be fixed separately

### Issue: Cooldown not working
**Check:**
- Trigger `trg_match_decline` exists
- Function `handle_match_decline` exists

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = 'matches'
AND trigger_name = 'trg_match_decline';
```

### Issue: Messages not appearing
**Check:**
- Messages table has correct structure
- Match ID is valid UUID

**Debug:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE match_id = '[match_id]';
```
