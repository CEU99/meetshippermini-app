# üöÄ Database Migration Execution Guide

## Quick Start

**Time Required:** 5 minutes
**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low (backward compatible, no data loss)

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Navigate to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your project: **mpsnsxmznxvoqcslcaom**

### Step 2: Open SQL Editor

1. In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New query"** button (top right)

### Step 3: Load Migration File

**Option A: Copy-Paste (Recommended)**
1. Open the file: `supabase/migrations/20250131_create_meetshipper_rooms.sql`
2. Copy all contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C / Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
3. Paste into the SQL Editor

**Option B: Upload File**
1. In SQL Editor, look for "Upload SQL file" option
2. Select: `supabase/migrations/20250131_create_meetshipper_rooms.sql`

### Step 4: Execute Migration

1. Review the SQL (optional - it's safe!)
2. Click **"Run"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)
3. Wait 3-5 seconds for execution

### Step 5: Verify Success

You should see these NOTICE messages in the output:

```
NOTICE:  üöÄ Creating meetshipper_rooms table...
NOTICE:    ‚úÖ meetshipper_rooms table created
NOTICE:    ‚úÖ Indexes created
NOTICE:    ‚úÖ RLS enabled
NOTICE:    ‚úÖ RLS policies created
NOTICE:    ‚úÖ Realtime enabled
NOTICE:    ‚úÖ Helper function created
NOTICE:  üéâ Ready for MeetShipper Conversation Rooms!
```

**If you see these messages: ‚úÖ Migration Successful!**

## Verification Queries

After successful migration, run these queries to double-check:

### Query 1: Check Table Exists
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as room_count FROM meetshipper_rooms;
```
**Expected:** Returns `0` (table exists, no rooms yet)

### Query 2: Check RLS Enabled
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'meetshipper_rooms';
```
**Expected:** Returns row with `rowsecurity = true`

### Query 3: Check Policies Exist
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'meetshipper_rooms'
ORDER BY policyname;
```
**Expected:** Returns 4 rows:
- "Matches can create rooms" (INSERT)
- "Service role has full access" (ALL)
- "Users can close their rooms" (UPDATE)
- "Users can view their own rooms" (SELECT)

### Query 4: Check Indexes
```sql
SELECT indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'meetshipper_rooms'
ORDER BY indexname;
```
**Expected:** Returns 5 indexes:
- idx_meetshipper_rooms_is_closed
- idx_meetshipper_rooms_match_id
- idx_meetshipper_rooms_user_a
- idx_meetshipper_rooms_user_b
- meetshipper_rooms_pkey (primary key)

## What the Migration Does

### Creates Table: `meetshipper_rooms`

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `match_id` | UUID | Links to matches table (unique) |
| `user_a_fid` | BIGINT | First participant |
| `user_b_fid` | BIGINT | Second participant |
| `is_closed` | BOOLEAN | Room closure status |
| `closed_by_fid` | BIGINT | Who closed it |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Creation timestamp |
| `closed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Closure timestamp |

### Security Features
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ‚úÖ Users can only see their own rooms
- ‚úÖ Users can only close rooms they're in
- ‚úÖ Backend has full access for automation

### Performance Features
- ‚úÖ 4 indexes for fast queries
- ‚úÖ Unique constraint on match_id
- ‚úÖ Foreign keys maintain data integrity

### Realtime Features
- ‚úÖ Realtime publication enabled
- ‚úÖ Both users receive instant updates
- ‚úÖ Room closure propagates immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation already exists"

**Cause:** Migration was already run previously

**Solution:** This is actually fine! The table already exists. Verify with:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meetshipper_rooms;
```

If this query works, you're good to go.

### Error: "permission denied"

**Cause:** Insufficient database permissions

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're logged in as the project owner
2. Check that you're using the correct project
3. Try refreshing the Supabase dashboard

### Error: "foreign key constraint"

**Cause:** Referenced tables (matches, users) don't exist

**Solution:** This is unlikely in your case, but verify:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

Both should return > 0.

## After Migration

### Immediate Effects

‚úÖ **Backend APIs will work**
- `/api/meetshipper-rooms/by-matches`
- `/api/meetshipper-rooms/[id]`
- `/api/meetshipper-rooms/[id]/close`

‚úÖ **Frontend will work**
- "MeetShipper Conversation Room" button appears
- Room page is accessible
- Closure functionality works

‚úÖ **Existing Matches Upgraded**
- 5 accepted matches will immediately show new button
- Users can start using rooms right away

‚ùå **Old System Unchanged**
- Old `chat_rooms` table untouched
- Previous chat history preserved
- No breaking changes

### Next Matches Created

For any NEW matches created after migration:
1. Both users accept
2. Backend creates `meetshipper_rooms` record
3. Both users see button
4. They can enter/exit freely
5. Either can close permanently

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to undo the migration:

```sql
-- Disable realtime
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime DROP TABLE meetshipper_rooms;

-- Drop helper function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ensure_meetshipper_room(UUID, BIGINT, BIGINT);

-- Drop table (cascades to policies and indexes)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS meetshipper_rooms CASCADE;
```

**Warning:** This will delete all conversation room data! Only use if absolutely necessary.

---

## Post-Migration Testing

### Quick Smoke Test

1. Go to your app: https://your-app-url.com/mini/inbox
2. Log in as a test user
3. Look for an accepted match
4. You should see "MeetShipper Conversation Room" button
5. Click it - room page should load
6. ‚úÖ Success!

### Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run automated tests
SUPABASE_URL="https://mpsnsxmznxvoqcslcaom.supabase.co" \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-key" \
npx tsx scripts/test-meetshipper-rooms.ts
```

**Expected:** 9/10 tests pass (100% success rate)

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the error message in SQL Editor
2. Review verification queries above
3. Check Supabase logs (Dashboard ‚Üí Logs)
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
