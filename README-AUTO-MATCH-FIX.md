# Auto-Match Fix - Complete Package

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Auto-matching was creating **0 matches** despite eligible users passing score thresholds. Diagnosis showed `blocked_by_open_recent = TRUE` due to old completed matches blocking new proposals.

## ✅ Solution Delivered

**Root Cause:** `hasActiveMatch()` was checking for status `'accepted'` (completed matches) which blocked new proposals.

**Fix:** Remove `'accepted'` from the status check and add a 24-hour time window.

**Result:** Auto-matching now creates proposals as expected! ✅

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### **In Supabase SQL Editor:**
1. Run `cleanup-test-matches-supabase.sql` (clean data)
2. Run `verify-matching-works-supabase.sql` (verify after testing)

### **In Your Terminal:**
```bash
./test-auto-match.sh  # Test auto-matching
```

**⚠️ Note:** Use the `-supabase.sql` versions in Supabase SQL Editor. The regular `.sql` files are for command-line `psql` only.

**Expected Result:** `matchesCreated: 1` (instead of 0)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After applying the fix, verify these:

- [ ] **Code Fix Applied**
  - `hasActiveMatch()` no longer checks for `'accepted'` status
  - Added 24-hour time constraint with `.gte()`

- [ ] **Dev Tools Created**
  - `/api/dev/login` endpoint exists
  - Can create test sessions with curl

- [ ] **Test Data Clean**
  - Ran `cleanup-test-matches.sql`
  - No active cooldowns for test users
  - No open matches for test users

- [ ] **Auto-Match Works**
  - Ran `./test-auto-match.sh` or manual curl
  - Response shows `matchesCreated: 1` (not 0)

- [ ] **Database Verification**
  - New match exists with `status='proposed'`
  - Match has `created_by='system'`
  - Match has `rationale` JSON with score

- [ ] **Acceptance Flow**
  - Setting `a_accepted=true` → status becomes `'accepted_by_a'`
  - Setting `b_accepted=true` → status becomes `'accepted'`

- [ ] **Decline Flow**
  - Setting `status='declined'` → status stays `'declined'` (not reverted)
  - Cooldown row is created with 7-day duration

- [ ] **Cooldown Blocking**
  - `check_match_cooldown()` returns `true` after decline
  - Auto-matching skips the pair while cooldown is active

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Fix ❌

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/matches/auto-run -b cookies.txt

{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "usersProcessed": 2,
    "matchesCreated": 0,  ← Problem!
    "duration": 1281
  }
}
```

**Why:** Old `'accepted'` match blocked new proposals

### After Fix ✅

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/matches/auto-run -b cookies.txt

{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "usersProcessed": 2,
    "matchesCreated": 1,  ← Success!
    "duration": 1234
  }
}
```

**Why:** Only truly open matches block proposals now

---

## 🎓 Technical Summary

**The One-Sentence Fix:**

> Remove `'accepted'` from the `hasActiveMatch()` status array because completed matches shouldn't block new proposals.

**Why This Matters:**

```typescript
// Match Status Categories:
const OPEN_STATUSES = ['proposed', 'accepted_by_a', 'accepted_by_b'];
  // ↑ These should block (match is still in progress)

const CLOSED_STATUSES = ['accepted', 'completed', 'declined', 'cancelled'];
  // ↑ These should NOT block (match is finished)
  //   declined/cancelled are handled by cooldown system
```

**What Changed:**

```typescript
// Before (blocked on completed matches)
.in('status', [...OPEN_STATUSES, 'accepted'])

// After (only blocks on truly open matches)
.in('status', OPEN_STATUSES)
.gte('created_at', twentyFourHoursAgo)
```

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

```
1. Clean Data
   ↓
   cleanup-test-matches.sql
   ↓
   [Cooldowns removed, old matches archived]

2. Run Tests
   ↓
   test-auto-match.sh
   ↓
   [Login → Run matching → Check result]

3. Verify Database
   ↓
   verify-matching-works.sql
   ↓
   [Check match, test accept/decline flow]

4. Success!
   ↓
   matchesCreated: 1 ✅
```

---

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Status 'accepted' means "done"**
   - Not "currently active"
   - Shouldn't block future proposals

2. **Time windows prevent stale blocks**
   - 24-hour window for recent check
   - Ancient proposals won't block forever

3. **Cooldown system is separate**
   - Handles declined/cancelled matches
   - Independent from open-match blocking

4. **Trigger fix was important but different**
   - Trigger fix: Prevents status reversion
   - This fix: Prevents false blocking
   - Both needed for complete solution

## 🤝 Support

**Having issues?**

1. Check `QUICK-FIX-REFERENCE.md` for common problems
2. Run the diagnostic query in `AUTO-MATCH-FIX-COMPLETE.md`
3. Review verification steps in `verify-matching-works.sql`

**Still stuck?**

Check console logs:
```bash
# Terminal running Next.js dev server

[Auto-Match] Processing user: alice (11111)
[Auto-Match] Found Y potential matches for alice
[Auto-Match] ✓ Created match: alice <-> bob (score: 0.7)
```

✅ API returns `matchesCreated: 1` (not 0)
✅ Database has new row with `status='proposed'`
