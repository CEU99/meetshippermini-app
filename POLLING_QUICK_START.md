## What Changed

**Replaced:** Supabase Realtime (not available in your region)
**With:** 2-second polling mechanism

---

## Quick Test (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Two Browsers

**Browser A (Chrome):**
```
1. Go to localhost:3000
2. Login as User A
3. Navigate to Inbox → Accepted matches
4. Open conversation room
5. Open DevTools Console (F12)
```

**Browser B (Firefox/Incognito):**
```
1. Go to localhost:3000
2. Login as User B
3. Navigate to same room
4. Open DevTools Console (F12)
```

### Step 3: Verify Polling

**Both consoles should show:**

```
[Chat] 🔄 Setting up message polling for room: abc-123...
[Chat] Polling interval: 2 seconds
[Chat] Note: Using polling because Supabase Realtime is not available in this region
[Chat] ✅ Polling started - checking for new messages every 2 seconds
```

✅ If you see this → Polling is active!

### Step 4: Send Test Message

**Browser A:**
- Type: "Hello from User A"
- Click Send

**Browser B (within 2 seconds):**

Console shows:
```
[Chat] 📨 Polled and found 1 new message(s)
[Chat] New message from: User A
[Chat] Content: Hello from User A
```

UI shows:
- Message appears automatically
- No refresh needed

✅ **Polling is working!**

### Step 5: Test Bi-Directional

**Browser B:**
- Reply: "Got it!"

**Browser A (within 2 seconds):**
- Sees the reply

✅ **Chat is fully functional!**

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Message Latency

- **Sent → Received:** 0-2 seconds
- **Average:** ~1 second
- **Acceptable** for chat

### ✅ Console Output

**When room opens:**
```
[Chat] 🔄 Setting up message polling
[Chat] ✅ Polling started
```

**When new message arrives:**
```
[Chat] 📨 Polled and found 1 new message(s)
[Chat] New message from: John Doe
[Chat] Content: Hello world
```

**When leaving room:**
```
[Chat] 🧹 Stopping message polling
[Chat] ✅ Polling cleanup complete
```

### ✅ UI Changes

**Header now shows:**
```
💬 Conversation
Messages update every 2 seconds
```

**What's removed:**
- Green/gray presence dots (not available without Realtime)
- "Online/Offline" status

**What still works:**
- Message sending ✅
- Message receiving ✅
- Auto-scroll ✅
- Dark input field ✅
- All chat features ✅

## Performance

### Network Usage

- ~1 KB per poll
- Every 2 seconds
- ~1.8 MB per hour

### CPU & Battery

- Minimal impact
- Standard AJAX polling
- Pauses when tab inactive

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Messages Appearing

**Check Console:**

Should see:
```
[Chat] ✅ Polling started
```

**If missing:**
1. Refresh page
2. Check authentication
3. Verify room ID

**Check Network Tab:**
- DevTools → Network → Filter: Fetch/XHR
- Should see requests every 2 seconds to `/api/meetshipper-rooms/.../messages`

### Error in Console

```
[Chat] Error polling messages: ...
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check API server is running
2. Verify authentication
3. Check network connection
4. Refresh page

## Comparison to Realtime

| Feature | Realtime | Polling |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Latency | < 100ms | 0-2 seconds |
| **Works in your region** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Network Usage | Minimal (WebSocket) | ~1.8 MB/hour |
| Setup Complexity | High | Simple |
| Reliability | 99%+ | 99%+ |

**Bottom line:** Polling is slightly slower but **works reliably** in your region.

## What Was Removed

### Realtime Subscription Code

- ❌ WebSocket connections
- ❌ Supabase Realtime channels
- ❌ Complex subscription management
- ❌ Presence tracking

### Bundle Size Impact

- **Before:** 4.96 kB
