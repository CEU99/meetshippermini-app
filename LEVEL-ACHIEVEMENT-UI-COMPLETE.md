### Wave System
**Progressive Unlock Logic:**

```
Wave 1 (Always Visible)
├─ Bio Done (50pts)
├─ Traits Done (50pts)
└─ 5 Match Requests (100pts)
    ↓ Complete all 3 to unlock Wave 2

Wave 2 (Unlocks after Wave 1)
├─ 10 Match Requests (100pts)
├─ 20 Match Requests (100pts)
└─ 30 Match Requests (100pts)
    ↓ Complete all 3 to unlock Wave 3

Wave 3 (Unlocks after Wave 2)
├─ 1 Completed Meeting (400pts)
├─ 5 Completed Meetings (400pts)
└─ 10 Completed Meetings (400pts)
    ↓ Complete all 3 to unlock Wave 4

Wave 4 (Final Challenge)
└─ 40 Completed Meetings (400pts)
    ↓ Reach Level 20 (MAX)
```

**Wave Progress Indicator:**
- 4 horizontal bars showing wave completion
- Green = completed
- Purple = current
- Gray = locked

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Updates

Both components automatically refresh when:
- Profile is updated (bio/traits added)
- Match request is created
- Meeting is marked as completed
- Page regains focus or becomes visible

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Listen for custom events
window.addEventListener('achievement-awarded', handleUpdate);
window.addEventListener('profile-updated', handleUpdate);
```

## 🐛 Error Handling

### Silent Failures
Both components fail silently if APIs are unavailable:
- Loading state shows during fetch
- If error occurs, component doesn't render
- Dashboard continues to work normally
- No user-facing errors

### Logging
All errors are logged to console with `[LevelProgress]` and `[Achievements]` prefixes for easy debugging.

---

## 🔍 Database Verification Queries

### Check user's level
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_levels WHERE user_fid = YOUR_FID;
```

### Check user's achievements
```sql
SELECT ua.*, a.code, a.points
FROM user_achievements ua
WHERE ua.user_fid = YOUR_FID
ORDER BY ua.awarded_at;
```

### Verify points match achievements
```sql
SELECT
  user_fid,
  SUM(points) as calculated_points,
  (SELECT points_total FROM user_levels WHERE user_fid = ua.user_fid) as stored_points
FROM user_achievements ua
WHERE user_fid = YOUR_FID
GROUP BY user_fid;
```

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```
Dashboard
├─ LevelProgress (client component)
│  ├─ Fetches /api/level/me
│  ├─ Displays progress bar
│  └─ Auto-refreshes on events
│
└─ Achievements (client component)
   ├─ Fetches /api/achievements/me
   ├─ AchievementCard × N (child components)
   ├─ Wave logic
   └─ Auto-refreshes on events
```

### Event System
```typescript
// Profile/achievement services dispatch events
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('achievement-awarded'));
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('profile-updated'));

// Components listen and refresh
window.addEventListener('achievement-awarded', fetchLevelData);
window.addEventListener('profile-updated', fetchAchievements);
```
