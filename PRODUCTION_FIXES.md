# Production Fixes Summary

This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve UX and session issues in the production environment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Message Input Field - White Text on White Background ✅

**Problem:** Chat input had invisible text (white on white background).

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `text-gray-900` for visible text color
- Added `placeholder:text-gray-500` for placeholder visibility
- Added `bg-white` to ensure consistent background
- Updated focus ring to `focus:ring-purple-400` for brand consistency
- Updated Send button to use gradient styling (`bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-pink-600`)

**File Modified:** `app/mini/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx:424`

---

### 2. Real-time Message Delivery (Optimistic UI) ✅

**Problem:** Messages only appeared after page refresh, not instantly after sending.

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented optimistic UI pattern
- Messages now appear instantly in the chat when sent
- Message is added to local state immediately with temporary ID
- Replaced with real message from server after API response
- If send fails, optimistic message is removed and text is restored for retry
- Supabase Realtime subscription was already in place, now works seamlessly with optimistic updates

**File Modified:** `app/mini/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx:169-214`

---

### 3. "Mark Meeting Completed" Button Behavior ✅

**Problem:** Button didn't navigate away after marking completed, causing confusion.

**Fix Applied:**
- After successfully marking meeting as completed, user is now navigated back to `/mini/inbox`
- Session and auth state remain intact (no logout)
- Shows success message before navigation

**File Modified:** `app/mini/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx:217-242`

---

### 4. "Back" Button Behavior ✅

**Problem:** No actual issue with Back button code, but session restoration was broken.

**Status:** Back button correctly navigates to `/mini/inbox` without touching session. Session persistence fix (below) resolves any perceived logout issues.

---

### 5. Page Refresh Logout Issue (Session Persistence) ✅

**Root Cause:** FarcasterAuthProvider relied solely on Farcaster Auth Kit's `useProfile()` hook, which doesn't persist across page refreshes in production. Even though JWT session cookie was valid, the provider wasn't checking it.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `FarcasterAuthProvider` to check JWT session cookie FIRST on page load
- New priority order:
  1. **Check `/api/auth/me` for existing JWT session** (NEW - persists across refreshes)
  2. Check dev session (development only)
  3. Check Farcaster Auth Kit profile
- Sessions now persist correctly across page refreshes in production
- Cookie settings verified and improved for production stability

**Files Modified:**
- `components/providers/FarcasterAuthProvider.tsx:44-77`
- `lib/auth.ts:20-48` (improved cookie configuration)
- `app/mini/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx:105-114` (use correct session endpoint in production)

## Deployment Checklist

### Required Environment Variables (Vercel)

Ensure ALL of these are set in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Neynar API Configuration
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key

# JWT Secret (must be a secure random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_random_jwt_secret_here

# CRITICAL: Set this to your production domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
# OR
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve production UX and session persistence issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel project
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure all variables above are set correctly
   - **CRITICAL:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must match your production domain

3. **Trigger new deployment:**
   - Vercel should auto-deploy on push
   - OR manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard

4. **Test in production:**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Sign in with Farcaster QR code
   - Open a chat and send messages (should appear instantly)
   - Refresh the page (should NOT log out)
   - Click "Back" button (should navigate without logout)
   - Click "Mark Meeting Completed" (should navigate to inbox)
   - Test navigation between pages (session should persist)

## Technical Details

### Session Persistence Architecture

**Before Fix:**
```
Page Load → FarcasterAuthProvider → useProfile() → Not persisted → User logged out
```

**After Fix:**
```
Page Load → FarcasterAuthProvider → Check JWT cookie (/api/auth/me) → Session restored → User stays logged in
```

### Cookie Configuration

The JWT session cookie is now configured with optimal settings:
- `httpOnly: true` - Prevents XSS attacks
- `secure: true` (in production) - Requires HTTPS
- `sameSite: 'lax'` - Prevents CSRF while allowing normal navigation
- `maxAge: 7 days` - Long-lived session
- `path: '/'` - Available across entire app

### Optimistic UI Pattern

Messages use a two-phase update:
1. **Optimistic:** Immediately show message with temporary ID
2. **Confirmed:** Replace with real message from server
3. **Rollback:** Remove if server returns error

This provides instant feedback while maintaining data integrity.

## Files Changed Summary

1. `app/mini/chat/[roomId]/page.tsx` - Chat UI, input styling, optimistic messages, navigation
2. `components/providers/FarcasterAuthProvider.tsx` - Session restoration from JWT
3. `lib/auth.ts` - Improved cookie configuration

---

## Expected Results After Deployment

✅ Chat input text is visible (dark gray on white background)
✅ Messages appear instantly when sent (no refresh needed)
✅ Real-time messages work for both participants
✅ "Mark Meeting Completed" navigates to inbox
✅ "Back" button safely returns to inbox
✅ Page refresh keeps user logged in
✅ Navigation between pages preserves session
✅ Overall behavior matches localhost experience

---

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues occur after deployment:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Check browser console for client-side errors
4. Verify Supabase Realtime is enabled for your project
5. If critical, rollback to previous deployment in Vercel dashboard

---

## Support & Testing

After deployment, test these scenarios:

1. **Fresh Login:** Clear all cookies → Sign in → Verify session persists
2. **Chat Flow:** Send messages → Verify instant appearance → Refresh → Verify messages still there
3. **Navigation:** Click Back → Verify no logout → Navigate between pages → Verify session persists
4. **Completion:** Mark meeting completed → Verify navigation to inbox → Verify no logout
5. **Multi-device:** Test with two users chatting in real-time

---

## Notes

- All fixes are backward compatible with localhost
- No database migrations required
- Supabase Realtime subscription was already implemented, just enhanced with optimistic UI
- Session persistence fix is critical for production stability
- Cookie settings follow security best practices
